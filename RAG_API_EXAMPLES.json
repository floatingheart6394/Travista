Expect to pay between $5-30 for most routes.\n\n2. **Trains** - While more expensive than buses, trains are still affordable, especially if you book in advance or purchase a Eurail Pass for multiple countries.\n\n3. **Budget Airlines** - Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz Air offer cheap flights if booked early.\n\n4. **Public Transportation** - Within cities, metro systems are affordable. Get a city pass for unlimited travel.\n\n5. **Overnight Buses/Trains** - These save on accommodation costs while traveling.",
